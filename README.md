# Recipes

There is a rough template to follow for any recipe in `/_template/`:

- `README.md` is the recipe so that Github shows the rendered Markdown as soon as you go to the folder.
- `assets` is for pictures / gifs / videos / etc to help with instructions or to show what the dish looks like. These are supposed to be embedded in the `README.md`, it's just an easy home for them.

### Breakfast
